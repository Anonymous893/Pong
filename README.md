# Pong
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game, programmed in Python and uses the Pygame library for graphics.

##### Rules
The game is played by two players, each controlling a paddle on opposite sides of the screen. The players can choose their names and Player 1 will be on the **right** while Player 2 will be on the **left**. 

The player on the right uses the keys _w_ and _s_ to move up and down. The player on the left uses the _up key_ and _down key_ to go up and down.

 The objective of the game is to score points by hitting the ball past the other player's paddle.

The game ends when one player reaches a score of 10 points. The player with the highest score at the end of the game is declared the winner.
